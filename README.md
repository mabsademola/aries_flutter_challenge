# Options Strategy Risk & Reward Analysis

This project implements an iOS & Android front-end application for options strategy risk and reward analysis using Flutter. The application generates a risk & reward graph for various options strategies, providing critical insights such as maximum profit, maximum loss, and break-even points.

## Features

- **Risk & Reward Graph**: Visualize the profit/loss for options strategies based on the underlying asset's price at expiry.
- **Interactive Chart**: Includes features like tooltips, trackball, crosshair, and zoom/pan for enhanced interactivity.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can enable or disable chart behaviors through a settings dialog.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Displays maximum profit, maximum loss, and break-even points for the given options strategy.
